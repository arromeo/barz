# To Do List
This is list of things that need to be done on the project.
### Refactoring
The rendering function is currently a mess with a lot of copied and pasted code. Some of this can be cleaned up by rolling repetitive code into helper functions and also making more efficient CSS calls by adding more classes.

### Features
Below are some additions that I would like to make to the library.

- More display options such as fonts, borders and shadows.
- Horizontal guides that display behind the bars.
- Hover over effect that would display more details.
- More types of graphs.
